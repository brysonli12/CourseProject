IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT CHROME EXTENSION:
Credit goes to CS 410 TAs (or whoever developed it originally) for originally developing this extension ( I took the relevant parts and slightly modified/extended it [simplified some parts of it for this final project], the server is something I did by myself). I do not claim to have developed the original version of this extension, but I have modified it to work with my server (where most of the work was done).
